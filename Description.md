# Student Performance Analysis

## Purpose
Analyze student performance data to identify patterns, factors influencing academic success, and propose strategies for improvement.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of student performance data:
1. Group E has the highest average scores among all race/ethnicity groups, followed by Group D, C, B, and A. All students ranked first are from Group E, and 9 out of the top 20 students also belong to this group.
2. Students with standard lunch have a significantly higher average score than those with free/reduced lunch. In fact, 17 of the top 20 students receive standard lunch, while 17 of the bottom 20 students are on free/reduced lunch.
3. Students whose parents hold higher education degrees tend to achieve better average scores, with the highest average scores found among students whose parents have a Master's degree. The top 20 students are mostly from families with a college degree, while the bottom 20 are dominated by those whose parents only completed high school.
4. Students who completed a test preparation course have higher average scores compared to those who didn't. Among the top 20 students, 13 completed the course, while 18 of the bottom 20 students didn't.
5. Looking at the patterns, economic background likely plays a role in these differences. Students with better financial support tend to have access to standard lunch, test preparation courses, and parents with higher education levels, which are closely linked to higher academic performance.

## Overall insight
The analysis indicates that higher academic performance is consistently associated with several key factors: higher parental education, access to standard lunch, and participation in test preparation courses. These patterns suggest a possible connection to students’ socioeconomic backgrounds, as families with greater financial resources are generally more able to provide these academic advantages.

Additionally, Group E, which records the highest average scores, appears to benefit from these factors more frequently than other groups. This finding highlights the potential role of economic disparities in shaping student outcomes, not only individually but also across demographic groups within the dataset.

## Suggestion
1. Create peer study groups or tutoring sessions where high-performing students can voluntarily help classmates in specific subjects.
2. Improve the quality of free/reduced lunch programs and offer subsidized standard lunch for students who couldn’t afford it.
3. Offer simple learning support sessions and hold basic parenting education programs to help parents support their children’s learning at home.
4. Offer free or low-cost test prep sessions and share online resources, especially targeting students who previously couldn’t access these courses.
